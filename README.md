Problem Statement

You are working for a new-age insurance company that employs multiple outreach plans to sell term insurance to your customers. Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective ways to reach out to people; however, they incur a lot of cost. Hence, it is important to identify the customers that are most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call.

You are provided with historical marketing data of the insurance company and are required to build a machine learning model that will predict if a client will subscribe to the insurance.

Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains information about the customers who were contacted during a marketing campaign for selling term deposit subscriptions. It consists of 10 input variables and 1 target variable indicating if the customer has subscribed or not. The dataset has 45205 rows and 11columns.

Project Overview
In this project, we will be performing the following steps:

Data Exploration: We will explore the dataset using various techniques to understand its structure, identify missing values, and detect outliers.
Data Preprocessing: We will preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers, perform feature engineering, and convert categorical variables into numerical ones.
Model Development: We will develop machine learning models using various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, K-nearest neighbors, XGBoost, and a voting classifier.
Model Evaluation: We will evaluate the performance of each model using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve.
Model Tuning: We will fine-tune the best performing model to improve its performance further.
Conclusion: We will draw conclusions based on our analysis and propose recommendations for the insurance company.

Technologies Used

This project was implemented using the following technologies:

Python 3.8.10
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Conclusion

This project aims to help the insurance company identify the customers who are most likely to convert, and hence, make their marketing campaigns more effective. By analyzing the historical marketing data, we developed several machine learning models and evaluated their performance. We fine-tuned the best performing model to improve its performance further. Our analysis provides valuable insights into the data and can be used to make data-driven decisions.
